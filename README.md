# DataAnalytics-Web-based-Education

Contains the analysis of the log files that we collected from MongoDB. These log files were generated across multiple lectures (around 19) as a part of our experiments with ASQ. We used ASQ, a web-mediated tool to give lectures to around 300 Bachelor students at TU Delft. The data generated contained around 2 million rows.
