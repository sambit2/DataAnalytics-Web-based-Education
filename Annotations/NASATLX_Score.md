## Interpretation:

NASA TLX scale helps us to determine the perceived workload while executing a task based on six different indicators like mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort invested and level of frustration. First the weight of each of the indicator is determined and then the raw rating is obtained which helps us to calculate the aggregated adjusted weighted rating. It is on a scale of 0-100. In our case, as we can see from the 14 lectures, both the instructors had higher workload when they first used ASQ (may be due to in-familiarity with the interface) which decreased with the progression of the course. Specifically in the first lecture (HTTP) the workload is very high because the cockpit view which shows the preview of the next slides did not work. Even the average workload for both the instructors through out the course was lower (around 30 and 40) indicating that ASQ can be used by teachers at ease.
